Title: Jumper Game
Description: The Hili Card Game is a game that asks a player to drawer a card and then guess if the next card will be a higher value or a lower value. If the player guesses correctly they are rewarded with 100 points, if they guess wrong then they loose 75 points.
A player can continue playing until they either choose to stop and keep their score, or they exhaust all their points.
